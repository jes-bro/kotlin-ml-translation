AI and Society Final Project: Python -> Kotlin

## Kotline Tour

### What features do you like about Kotlin?
I like the Elvis operator, I don't know if that's a universal term for something that checks for a nulltype and returns something other than null. Also, I like the val vs. var distinction, I think it's very intuitive naming and is more legitimate than python's capitalization convention. The do while and when do syntax were interesting to me and I enjoyed thinking through the do-while statements in more English terms: "Do this while this is condition is true".

### Are there things you were expecting to find that you havenâ€™t?
Something that I expected was a heavier use of if-statements, but they recommend using when instead. Also, I don't remember seeing "import as" syntax in the tutroial, though I know it exists in the language now after trying it. So, I had expected to see that and didn't see it when going through the tour. 

### What questions do you have?
I think some of the use cases of the different lambda function versions aren't entirely clear to me- I think I generally understand when they are useful, but could use a little more practice implementing them in Kotlin.
